### The main idea of the project:
How often did you have to contact a new specialist for help? How do you look for a good dentist or hairdresser? Of course, in most cases you are guided by word of mouth that can advise you a good organization / employee. But with all this it is very subjective and does not reflect the real quality of the work of this specialist. Maybe he passed the refresher courses and now provides services at a new level?

Another example is poor service and unworthy behavior on the part of employees. In this case, you write an application addressed to the director of the company and ask him to understand the situation and punish the guilty. At the same time, it is not possible, when addressing a new specialist, to know in advance how many complaints there are. Although no, there is. The word of mouth helps us!

The site was created to replace the word of mouth. The main means of popularizing which are the grandmothers at the entrances. Now everyone can sit at home, find a good specialist and contact him. For this, you do not need to ring up all your friends and ask for advice. It is enough to go to the site, choose a specialty and find what you need.
